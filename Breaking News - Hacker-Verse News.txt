Hackers Doing CTF too Busy Finding Flags to Notice Alien Invasion 

Quadrant 1337, Hacker-Verse---Long-range sensors have picked up a strange cube-shaped spaceship that has mysteriously entered from the far edge of the Hacker Quadrant. It broadcasted a message to every device: 
"We are the Borg. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us."
Afterwards, the image of a creepy mechanized cyborg appeared. Among all its various Fitbits, Go Pros, AR monocle, and other useless bluetooth wearables, it donned what looked like one of those silly Anonymous masks that script-kiddies like to put on before firing off "/bin/sh m4lwar3z.exe" at every ip address they see.
The message continued..
"Lower your firewalls and surrender your private data. Your servers will be added to our own. From this time forward, you will service us by mining crypto. You will be de-anonymized. Resistance is futile."
Citizen hackers across the Hacker-Verse were unanimous in agreement that there is no fate worse than dox and rallied to fight back against the alien threat. The HNN will update this story as it develops.
